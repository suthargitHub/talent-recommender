Founder Journey - Talking Head Style Videos,"<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm the CEO &amp; founder of a seed-stage startup. I am trying to make 3-5 videos per week about a range of topics covering startups, founder journey, and sales &amp; marketing. I post these to LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok as a way to build awareness of myself and my company, in order to generate leads for my business. I'm finding it difficult to make the time for filming and editing consistently alongside my other responsibilities. I&rsquo;m looking for someone to help with the editing side of things. I can supply the 4K video files and I need a hand with editing them into the final product. I don't have a strong preference for video editing software, so whatever you prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video is still a relatively underused format on LinkedIn, and I would like my videos to stand out with a touch more quality in the edit than most other content on that platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this something you think you&rsquo;d be open to building a long term relationship with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to have a look at my LinkedIn profile to see some of my recent videos for an idea of my content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>",Video Editor,NULL,NULL,NULL,3000,month,Education,"Color Grading, Rough Cut & Sequencing, Sound Designing, Sourcing Stock Footage, Splice & Dice, Storyboarding, Subtitling, Thumbnail Design",NULL,"TikTok, YouTube","Aesthetic, Eccentric, Energetic, Fast-Paced, Helpful, Talking Head","https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tobiaswillcocks_people-management-is-an-irrelevant-skill-activity-7206592812874674176-EKj9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8mFCRohlOA, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq0VDeyMMW4, https://youtu.be/ajg_Jz37maU, https://youtu.be/YT7tQzmGRLA?si=JTYw-XvDlW2U5AYe"
